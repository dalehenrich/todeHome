On the next run jenkins fails and I\'ve got to manually delete those leftover files in the /tmp/ directory.\n\nThe three solutions I can think of to fix that are\n1. get a better connection\n2. append a random string to the front or end of those filenames so they don\'t conflict.\n3. check for and delete those filenames before starting the downloads.\n\nI don\'t imagine I\'ll have two images downloading the same file at the same time so 3 would be the easiest probably to implement, but two may be more robust in a multiuser system\n\nLet me know what you think.',#runs:RunArray{#runs:[691],#values:[[TextColor{#color:Color{#rgb:0}}]],#lastIndex:nil,#lastRun:nil,#lastOffset:nil}},#creationTime:DateAndTime['2013-12-06T16:37:24.78079795837402-08:00'],#modificationTime:@9}
