TDTxtLeafNode{#name:'analysis',#contents:Text{#string:'I\'m getting jenkins running with a lousy connection and some times the downloads time out and .zip .err and .out files are left in /tmp/. On the next run jenkins fails and I\'ve got to manually delete those leftover files in the /tmp/ directory.

The three solutions I can think of to fix that are
1. get a better connection
2. append a random string to the front or end of those filenames so they don\'t conflict.
3. check for and delete those filenames before starting the downloads.

I don\'t imagine I\'ll have two images downloading the same file at the same time so 3 would be the easiest probably to implement, but two may be more robust in a multiuser system

Let me know what you think.',#runs:RunArray{#runs:[691],#values:[[TextColor{#color:Color{#rgb:0}}]],#lastIndex:nil,#lastRun:nil,#lastOffset:nil}},#creationTime:DateAndTime['2013-12-06T17:30:30.22867488861084-08:00'],#modificationTime:@9}
